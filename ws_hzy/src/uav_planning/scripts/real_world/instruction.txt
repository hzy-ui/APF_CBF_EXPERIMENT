Certainly! In the code you provided, the quadratic programming problem can be defined as follows:

Minimize: 0.5 * x^T * P * x + q^T * x

Subject to: G * x <= h

Where:

x is a 2-dimensional vector representing the variables to be optimized.
P is the 2x2 quadratic cost matrix.
q is the 2-dimensional linear cost vector.
G is the 4x2 inequality constraint matrix.
h is the 4-dimensional inequality constraint vector.
The objective function is a quadratic function with the quadratic term represented by the matrix multiplication x^T * P * x and the linear term represented by q^T * x. The goal is to find the values of x that minimize the objective function while satisfying the inequality constraints G * x <= h.

The solution to the quadratic programming problem is obtained by calling the solvers.qp() function from the cvxopt library. The optimal solution is then extracted from the sol object. The optimal solution, stored in the optimal_solution variable, represents the values of the variables x that minimize the objective function while satisfying the inequality constraints.

To print the optimal solution, the code uses print("Optimal solution:") followed by print(optimal_solution). This will display the values of the variables x that provide the optimal solution to the quadratic programming problem.

Please note that the actual values of P, q, G, and h in your code are randomly generated, so the specific solution will vary each time you run the code.
